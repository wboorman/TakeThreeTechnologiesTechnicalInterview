# Technical Interview Assessment

Thank you for participating in the technical interview assessment! This assessment is designed to test your skill set for feature design and bug fixes in the following areas:

* Code quality
* Ability to understand existing code
* Communication (either in questions if they come up, comments, or commit messages)

## The Project

Your assessment involves a fairly simple application: A calculator. This calculator performs all of its operations server side and returns the results through an API layer within the application.

### Requirements to Run:
* Visual Studio 2019 (Community) [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

### Commit Message Requirements
Your commit messages are your own and should be written in a way that you think is appropriate, but please include a reference to the feature, bug, or extra credit that is related to your commit message.

### Time Expectations

This is designed to be a quick project that should take no longer than an afternoon, at most. Please try to return your results within four business days of receiving this assessment. If you need to take longer, please contact your interviewer and let them know.

### Upon Completion of Project

Follow the steps provided in the **Final Task** listed below.

## The Assessment

#### Before you get started, [click here to generate a new repository from this template](https://github.com/takethree/interview-assessment-junior/generate). This will create a repository in your account with your own copy of the code.

### Bug #1: Fix StyleCop Errors

The Lead Developer on your team recently implemented StyleCop to enforce code quality standards, and now your project does not compile. Fix the code quality errors that are blocking the code from compiling.

### Bug #2: Calculator not returning a value

A user has reported that any time you try and calculate a value, it is just returning `0`. It doesn't mater what value you attempt, it always returns `0`.

As there are no errors happening in the API call to the server that runs the calculation, your Lead Developer believes that the issue is occurring within the calculation logic itself.

### Final Task: Run the Project

To complete this task, all you need to do is:

**Provide Screenshots**

* Provide a screen shot with the project opened in Visual Studio 2019
* Provide a screen shot that shows all errors have been corrected (no errors in the "Error List" in the bottom of Visual Studio)
* Provide a screen shot showing the application running in a web browser of your choice

Send the screen shots listed above back to your interviewer upon completion of all items in this assessment.

**Upload Your Code**

* Upload your fixed code to a repository on GitHub and include a link to the repository in your email back to your interviewer
